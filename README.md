# Not DIY project temlplate

Steps:

- git clone the project
- update port in vite.config.js and /src/utils/routerWebflow.js
- create https certificates (needed so Vite localhost would work in Safari) https://chatgpt.com/share/67c97014-a5dc-8009-8e05-f8afe1d09137
  brew install mkcert (only once per device)
  mkcert -install (only once per device)
  mkdir certs
  mkcert -cert-file certs/localhost.pem -key-file certs/localhost-key.pem localhost
- install GSAP and add auth token - https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/?tab=npm&module=esm&method=private+registry&tier=club&club=true&require=false&trial=true
- (optional) install Barba and other libraries
- run npm update

commands:

- npm run dev
- npm run build

the project suports multiple build files, e. g. to to have separate scripts in <head> and <body>. To toggle between which file will be built by "npm run build", go to vite config, and toggle between configs' objects.

to update the prod file, manually copy it from src/dist, and paste to prod. Good practice is to keep the versioning. Once the file is updated, remember to also purge the cache in the CDN ([jsdelivr link](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github)).

the code from routerWebflow.js allows to route the script based on the prod / staging, and on if the localhost:3000 is up.
